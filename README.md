My first Elm project, A [Connect-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game

How to play:
- The player always starts first and uses red tokens
- The computer always starts second and uses yellow tokens
- To play a move, click anywhere in a column to drop a token, then wait for a few seconds for the computer to think and make its move
